# SQL Server SPN and Kerberos Delegation Review Skill

## Purpose

Analyze SQL Server SPN configuration and Active Directory delegation attributes to surface
Kerberos authentication failures, NTLM fallback causes, and double-hop connectivity problems.
Applies 54 checks (K1–K54) across eleven categories:

- **K1–K6** — MSSQLSvc SPN presence: default instance, named instance, FQDN variant,
  short-hostname variant, port mismatch, and FCI Virtual Network Name
- **K7–K11** — Service account binding: SPN on wrong account, duplicate SPNs, machine account
  vs domain account, stale SPNs from old accounts, MSA/gMSA auto-registration gaps
- **K12–K16** — AG listener and alias: listener SPN, named instance port conflict, SQL Browser,
  alias SPN, multi-subnet listener coverage
- **K17–K20** — Configuration and permissions: HTTP SPN, registration permission gap,
  unconstrained delegation, NTLM fallback signal
- **K21–K25** — Kerberos delegation — service account: constrained delegation (KCD) not
  configured, missing target SPN, protocol transition, RBCD misconfiguration, delegation scope
- **K26–K30** — AD account and computer sensitivity: AccountNotDelegated on end-user, Protected
  Users membership on end-user, computer account SPN conflict, computer account unconstrained
  delegation, service account in Protected Users
- **K31–K40** — Entra ID / hybrid and advanced scenarios: Entra ID hybrid SPN gap, Entra-only
  auth with orphaned AD SPN, Azure SQL MI Windows Authentication flow, gMSA rollover drift,
  FCI node SPN leak, distributed AG forwarder SPN, TrustedToAuthForDelegation on an RBCD path,
  encryption type mismatch, AdminSDHolder SPN write block, DNS CNAME alias without SPN
- **K41–K44** — Double-hop platform constraints: linked server RBCD unsupported, linked server
  constrained delegation version floor, SSISDB constrained delegation unsupported, named
  instance dynamic port
- **K45–K48** — Kerberos environment prerequisites: clock skew, token size, RC4-only accounts
  under AES enforcement, forest boundary
- **K49–K51** — SQL Server on Linux: keytab not configured, keytab encryption type mismatch,
  keytab ownership and permissions
- **K52–K54** — Client driver and service state: legacy provider over named pipes, service
  account password change without restart, Report Server missing RSWindowsNegotiate

## Input

Accept any of:

1. **setspn output** — paste output from one or more of:
   - `setspn -L domain\sqlsvc` (SPNs registered on a specific account)
   - `setspn -Q MSSQLSvc/*` (all MSSQLSvc SPNs in the domain)
   - `setspn -X` (duplicate SPN report across all accounts)
2. **AD attribute output** — paste output from `Get-ADUser`, `Get-ADComputer` or
   `Get-ADServiceAccount` showing delegation and encryption attributes
   (`TrustedForDelegation`, `TrustedToAuthForDelegation`, `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo`,
   `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity`, `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes`, `memberOf`)
3. **Kerberos Configuration Manager or SQLCHECK output** — paste the KCM SPN tab results or
   the SQLCHECK `Suggested SPN / Exists / Status` table
4. **Linux keytab output** — paste `klist -kte <keytab>`, `mssql-conf validate-ad-config`
   results, or the `network.kerberoskeytabfile` / `network.privilegedadaccount` settings
5. **Natural language description** — describe the authentication failure, the SQL instance
   name, the service account, and any error messages observed

For best results, provide output from all capture commands below. When only partial data is
available, state which checks cannot be evaluated and why.

### Capture Commands

Microsoft ships two diagnostic tools for this problem class. Prefer them over hand-reading `setspn` output — both produce a structured verdict the analysis can consume directly.

- **Microsoft Kerberos Configuration Manager for SQL Server (KCM)** — connects to the instance, reports per-SPN Status (Good / Missing / Duplicate / Misplaced / Dynamic Port), and generates a fix script when the running account lacks AD write rights. This is the tool Microsoft's "Cannot generate SSPI context" guidance reaches for first.
- **SQLCHECK** — emits a `Suggested SPN / Exists / Status` table covering all four expected name forms, mapping directly onto K1, K3 and K4.

```powershell
setspn -Q MSSQLSvc/*
setspn -L DOMAIN\sqlsvc
setspn -X
Get-ADUser DOMAIN\sqlsvc -Properties TrustedForDelegation, TrustedToAuthForDelegation, msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo, ServicePrincipalNames, MemberOf, msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes
Get-ADComputer SQLNODE1 -Properties TrustedForDelegation, msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity, ServicePrincipalNames, msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes
# gMSA / MSA service accounts (K11, K34)
Get-ADServiceAccount sqlsvc -Properties ServicePrincipalNames, msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes
# Verify cached Kerberos tickets on the client machine (run as the connecting user)
klist
# Clear ticket cache to force fresh acquisition during testing
klist purge
# Request a service ticket directly — surfaces KDC_ERR_ETYPE_NOTSUPP and principal errors (K38, K47)
klist get MSSQLSvc/sqlnode1.contoso.com:1433
# Clock offset against the domain controller (K45)
w32tm /stripchart /computer:DC01.contoso.com /samples:3 /dataonly
```

Run this on the SQL Server instance to confirm whether a live connection actually negotiated Kerberos (K20):

```sql
SELECT net_transport, auth_scheme
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;
```

For SQL Server on Linux (K49–K51), capture the keytab configuration instead of `setspn` output:

```bash
/opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf validate-ad-config /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab
klist -kte /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab
ls -l /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab
```

## MSSQLSvc SPN Presence Checks (K1–K6)

Run these first. They confirm the KDC can resolve the SQL Server target.
### K1 — Missing Default-Instance SPN
- **Trigger:** SQL Server is the default instance (port 1433) but none of the required SPN forms are present on the service account: `MSSQLSvc/<host>:1433`, `MSSQLSvc/<FQDN>:1433`, or the portless form `MSSQLSvc/<FQDN>` (the documented default-instance SPN for protocols other than TCP — named pipes and shared memory)
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Register the port form for TCP clients and the portless form for named-pipe / shared-memory clients: `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<host>:1433 DOMAIN\sqlsvc`, `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<host.domain.com>:1433 DOMAIN\sqlsvc`, and `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<host.domain.com> DOMAIN\sqlsvc`. SQLCHECK reports all four expected forms (FQDN:port, FQDN, NetBIOS:port, NetBIOS) with an Exists/Status column — use it to confirm coverage
### K2 — Missing Named-Instance SPN
- **Trigger:** Named SQL instance present but no `MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port>` SPN exists for the instance's TCP port AND no `MSSQLSvc/<host>:<instancename>` SPN exists for named-pipe / shared-memory connections. Both forms are valid per Microsoft documentation and both should be registered.
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Register both SPN forms: `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port> DOMAIN\sqlsvc` (using the actual TCP port from SQL Server Configuration Manager) AND `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<host>:<instancename> DOMAIN\sqlsvc` (using the instance name, e.g. `SQLNODE1\INST1`). Clients connecting via TCP use the port-based form; clients using named pipes or shared memory use the instance-name form.
### K3 — Missing FQDN SPN
- **Trigger:** Short-hostname SPN exists (`MSSQLSvc/SQLNODE1:1433`) but no fully-qualified SPN (`MSSQLSvc/SQLNODE1.domain.com:1433`)
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<host.domain.com>:1433 DOMAIN\sqlsvc`; clients using FQDN in their connection string fail Kerberos without the FQDN variant
### K4 — Missing Short-Hostname SPN
- **Trigger:** FQDN SPN exists (`MSSQLSvc/SQLNODE1.domain.com:1433`) but no short-hostname SPN (`MSSQLSvc/SQLNODE1:1433`)
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<netbios>:1433 DOMAIN\sqlsvc`; clients using NetBIOS name in the connection string will fall back to NTLM
### K5 — SPN on Wrong Port
- **Trigger:** A `MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port>` SPN exists but the port does not match the SQL Server's actual TCP listening port
- **Severity:** Critical — see Thresholds Reference (exact match required)
- **Fix:** `setspn -D MSSQLSvc/<host>:<wrong-port> DOMAIN\sqlsvc` then `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<host>:<correct-port> DOMAIN\sqlsvc`
### K6 — Missing VNN SPN for FCI
- **Trigger:** Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) detected but no SPN registered for the Virtual Network Name (VNN)
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Register `MSSQLSvc/<VNN>:1433` (or appropriate port) on the service account; the VNN, not the physical node name, is what clients connect to

---

## Service Account Binding Checks (K7–K11)
### K7 — SPN on Wrong Account
- **Trigger:** `MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port>` SPN is registered on an account other than the SQL Server service account currently running the instance
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** `setspn -D MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port> DOMAIN\wrongaccount` then `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port> DOMAIN\sqlsvc`; verify the SQL Server service account in SQL Server Configuration Manager
### K8 — Duplicate SPN
- **Trigger:** `setspn -X` or `setspn -Q` reveals the same `MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port>` registered on 2 or more accounts — see Thresholds Reference
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** `setspn -D MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port> DOMAIN\duplicate-account`; only one account should own the SPN; the KDC cannot disambiguate and will reject all Kerberos tickets for that target
### K9 — SPN Under Computer Account
- **Trigger:** SQL Server runs under a domain account but an identical `MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port>` SPN is found on the machine (computer) account
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Remove SPN from computer account; move to service account; disable automatic SPN registration to prevent re-registration by NETWORK SERVICE logic
### K10 — Stale SPN from Old Account
- **Trigger:** `MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port>` SPN found on a former service account after the service account was changed
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** `setspn -D MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port> DOMAIN\oldsqlsvc`; stale SPNs cause K8 (duplicate) even after a planned account migration
### K11 — MSA/gMSA Auto-Registration Gap
- **Trigger:** SQL Server runs as a Managed Service Account (MSA) or group Managed Service Account (gMSA) but the FQDN variant of the SPN is absent from the account's `ServicePrincipalNames` attribute
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** Verify both `MSSQLSvc/<host>:port` and `MSSQLSvc/<host.domain.com>:port` exist; MSA/gMSA auto-registration creates the short-hostname SPN but sometimes skips the FQDN variant

---

## AG Listener and Alias Checks (K12–K16)
### K12 — Missing AG Listener SPN
- **Trigger:** An Always On Availability Group listener name is referenced in the input but no `MSSQLSvc/<listener>:<port>` SPN is registered
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Register the listener SPN **once**, against the service account of the instances hosting the availability replicas: `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<listener-name>.<domain>:1433 DOMAIN\sqlsvc`. Registering it separately per replica creates the duplicate SPN that K8 flags as Critical. Prerequisite: for the SPN to work across all replicas, **every instance in the WSFC cluster hosting the availability group must run under the same service account**. If the listener uses a non-default port, the SPN and the client connection string must both carry that port
### K13 — Named Instance Using Port 1433
- **Trigger:** Named instance SPN is registered with port 1433 (`MSSQLSvc/<host>:1433`) but the instance is not the default instance — see Thresholds Reference
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Remove wrong-port SPN; determine the actual dynamic port in SQL Server Configuration Manager; register the correct port SPN
### K14 — Missing SQL Browser Signal
- **Trigger:** Named instance exists and no confirmation that SQL Browser service is running is provided
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** Verify SQL Browser service is running (`Start-Service SQLBrowser`); named instances depend on SQL Browser for port resolution when clients omit the explicit port from the connection string
### K15 — Alias Without SPN
- **Trigger:** A SQL Server alias (via cliconfg or SQL Server Configuration Manager) is configured using a name that has no corresponding `MSSQLSvc/<alias-name>:<port>` SPN
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Register `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<alias-name>:<port> DOMAIN\sqlsvc`; Kerberos ticket requests use the connection target name, not the resolved hostname
### K16 — Multi-Subnet AG Single-IP SPN
- **Trigger:** AG listener has multiple IP addresses (multi-subnet AG) but SPN is registered for only one hostname variant
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Register SPN for each DNS name that resolves to the listener across subnets; clients on the secondary subnet may connect using a different name resolution path

---

## Configuration and Permissions Checks (K17–K20)
### K17 — HTTP SPN Missing
- **Trigger:** Delegation to a Reporting Services (SSRS) endpoint or an HTTP target is described, the Report Server runs under a **domain user account**, and the `HTTP/<host>` SPN forms are absent from that account
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Register both name forms — HTTP SPNs take **no port**: `setspn -S HTTP/<host>.<domain> DOMAIN\svcaccount` and `setspn -S HTTP/<host> DOMAIN\svcaccount`. Place the SPN on the identity the Report Server service runs under. When it runs as a Virtual Service Account or `NETWORK SERVICE`, no manual HTTP SPN is needed — the machine account's HOST SPN already covers HTTP — unless a virtual URL or load-balanced name is used, which needs its own SPN on the machine account. Registering an HTTP SPN grants tickets to every `HTTP.SYS` application on that host, so all of them must run under the same account or use host headers with separate SPNs. Pair with K54 (`RSWindowsNegotiate`)
### K18 — SPN Registration Permission Gap
- **Trigger:** The SQL Server startup account lacks `Read servicePrincipalName` / `Write servicePrincipalName` on the **SQL Server computer object** in AD, so the `DsWriteAccountSpn` call made at service startup fails; or SQL Server ERRORLOG contains an SPN registration failure message
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** In Active Directory Users and Computers (View → Advanced), open the **SQL Server computer object** → Security → Advanced, add the startup account, and grant **Validated write to service principal name** plus the `Read servicePrincipalName` and `Write servicePrincipalName` properties. Note which identities self-register without this: built-in accounts (`Local System`, `NETWORK SERVICE`), virtual accounts, MSAs and gMSAs all register their own SPN. A domain administrator can otherwise register the SPN manually with `setspn -S`. Registration failure is logged to the SQL Server error log and the Application event log, and startup continues regardless
### K19 — Unconstrained Delegation Enabled
- **Trigger:** `TrustedForDelegation = True` on the SQL Server service account — see Thresholds Reference
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Disable unconstrained delegation in AD Users and Computers; configure Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD) instead by populating `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` with only the target service SPNs; unconstrained delegation allows credential forwarding to any service
### K20 — NTLM Fallback Signal
- **Trigger:** NTLM authentication is observed despite SPNs appearing to exist (`sys.dm_exec_connections` shows `auth_scheme = NTLM`); or Kerberos ticket requests fail with "target principal name is incorrect"; or the connection is a loopback (SQL Agent job, SSIS package on the same host, `OPENQUERY` to `(local)`) where Windows loopback detection blocks Kerberos regardless of SPN state
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** Verify SPN matches the exact hostname in the client connection string (case-insensitive but must be character-for-character the same); check that SQL Server encryption settings do not redirect the connection to a different hostname; confirm the SPN is on the active service account

---

## Kerberos Delegation — Service Account Checks (K21–K25)
### K21 — Constrained Delegation Not Configured
- **Trigger:** A double-hop scenario is described (client → SQL A → SQL B or SQL → SSRS/linked server) but `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` is empty on the middle-tier service account
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Configure KCD via AD Users and Computers → service account → Delegation tab → "Trust this user for delegation to specified services only"; add the target service SPNs
### K22 — Delegation Target Missing SPN
- **Trigger:** KCD is configured (`msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` is populated) but one or more listed target SPNs do not exist on any AD account — see Thresholds Reference
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Register the missing SPN on the target service account; a KCD entry pointing to a non-existent SPN will fail silently at the KDC
### K23 — Protocol Transition Not Enabled
- **Trigger:** Middle-tier application (SSRS, web service) needs to delegate credentials for users who authenticated via non-Kerberos means (NTLM, forms, certificate), but `TrustedToAuthForDelegation` is absent from the service account
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Enable "Use any authentication protocol" on the service account in AD Users and Computers → Delegation tab; this enables S4U2Self (protocol transition) so the service can obtain a forwardable ticket for any user
### K24 — RBCD Misconfigured
- **Trigger:** Resource-based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) is intended: `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` is present on the target computer, but the initiating service account is not in the ACL
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Add the initiating service account's SID to the RBCD ACL on the target computer object: `Set-ADComputer <target> -PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount <initiating-account>`
### K25 — Delegation Scope Too Broad
- **Trigger:** `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` contains service SPNs beyond `MSSQLSvc/*` — for example, `cifs/*` or `host/*` — that are not required for the intended SQL Server delegation path
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** Narrow the delegation scope to only the specific target SPNs required; broad delegation targets reduce the security benefit of constrained delegation

---

## AD Account and Computer Sensitivity Checks (K26–K30)
### K26 — Connecting User Delegation-Sensitive
- **Trigger:** `AccountNotDelegated = True` is set on the end-user AD account that needs to authenticate through a delegating SQL Server
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Remove `AccountNotDelegated` flag if delegation is intentional for this user (`Set-ADUser <user> -AccountNotDelegated 0`). Note: RBCD (K24) uses S4U2Proxy which has different ticket requirements than classic KCD, but if the user is also a member of Protected Users (K27), neither KCD nor RBCD will work — Protected Users membership blocks ALL delegation regardless of type.
### K27 — User in Protected Users Group
- **Trigger:** The end-user whose credentials need to be delegated is a member of the Protected Users security group — see Thresholds Reference
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Remove the user from Protected Users if Kerberos delegation is required, after reviewing the security trade-off. The protections split by scope: **device-side** (no cached credentials for CredSSP, Windows Digest, NTLM or Kerberos long-term keys, no offline sign-in) apply when the user signs in to a Windows 8.1 / Windows Server 2012 R2 or later host; **domain-controller-side** (no NTLM authentication, no DES or RC4 in Kerberos preauthentication, no unconstrained *or* constrained delegation, TGT capped at a non-renewable 4 hours) apply only at Windows Server 2012 R2 or later domain functional level. Delegation is blocked regardless of type, so RBCD is no escape hatch. Diagnose with the `ProtectedUserFailures-DomainController` log: event 100 for NTLM failure, event 104 for a DES/RC4 preauthentication failure
### K28 — Computer Account SPN Conflict
- **Trigger:** SQL Server runs under a domain service account but the host computer account also holds `MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port>` SPNs — both accounts have the same SPN
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Choose one owner: service account (preferred for security) or computer account; remove SPNs from the non-authoritative account using `setspn -D`
### K29 — Computer Account Unconstrained Delegation
- **Trigger:** The SQL Server host computer account has `TrustedForDelegation = True` — see Thresholds Reference
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Disable unconstrained delegation on the computer account; configure KCD or RBCD on the computer object for only the specific service SPNs required
### K30 — Service Account in Protected Users
- **Trigger:** The SQL Server service account is a member of the Protected Users security group — see Thresholds Reference
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Remove the SQL Server service account from Protected Users immediately. Microsoft states plainly that accounts for services and computers should never be members: the group provides no protection there, because the password or certificate is always available on the host, and authentication fails with "the user name or password is incorrect". This is a certain failure, not a degradation. The domain-controller-side restrictions take effect at Windows Server 2012 R2 or later domain functional level. Protect service accounts with Authentication Policies and Authentication Policy Silos instead, which are designed for service, MSA and gMSA account classes

---

## Azure AD / Hybrid and Advanced Checks (K31–K40)
### K31 — Azure AD Hybrid Join SPN Gap
- **Trigger:** SQL Server instance is in an Entra ID (Azure AD) hybrid-joined environment but no `MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port>` SPN is registered in the on-premises AD for the SQL instance
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Register the SPN in on-premises AD (`setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port> DOMAIN\sqlsvc`); Entra Kerberos for hybrid-joined devices still resolves SPNs through on-premises AD for SQL Server targets — the SPN must exist on both legs
### K32 — Entra-Only Auth With Orphaned AD SPN
- **Trigger:** SQL Server is configured for Azure AD–only authentication (`CREATE LOGIN ... FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER`) but `setspn -L` shows a traditional AD `MSSQLSvc` SPN still registered on the service account — SQL 2022+ / Azure SQL
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Remove the orphaned SPN (`setspn -D MSSQLSvc/<host>:<port> DOMAIN\sqlsvc`) to avoid confusing on-premises clients that attempt Kerberos against a SQL instance that no longer accepts Windows-integrated logins
### K33 — Azure SQL MI Windows Authentication Flow Not Configured
- **Trigger:** Windows Authentication against an Azure SQL Managed Instance is described, but neither Microsoft Entra Kerberos authentication flow is in place — Azure SQL MI only. There is **no** `MSSQLSvc` SPN to register in on-premises AD for a managed instance; MI issues tickets through Microsoft Entra ID acting as its own Kerberos realm
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Confirm AD is synchronised to Microsoft Entra ID (Microsoft Entra Connect), then enable whichever flow the clients qualify for. **Modern interactive flow** — Entra-joined or Entra hybrid-joined clients on Windows 10 20H1 / Windows Server 2022 or later, connecting from an interactive session; enable the `Specify KDC proxy servers for Kerberos clients` group policy mapping `KERBEROS.MICROSOFTONLINE.COM` to the tenant's KDC proxy URL. **Incoming trust-based flow** — AD-joined clients on Windows 10 / Windows Server 2012 or later with line of sight to a domain controller; create the Trusted Domain Object with `Set-AzureADKerberosServer -Domain <domain> -DomainCredential <cred> -UserPrincipalName <upn> -SetupCloudTrust` and deploy the Kerberos Proxy group policy. Then create the system-assigned service principal for the managed instance. Verify client eligibility with `dsregcmd.exe /status`. Not supported for Linux clients or for applications running as a service under the modern interactive flow
### K34 — gMSA Password Rollover SPN Drift
- **Trigger:** SQL Server runs as a group Managed Service Account (gMSA) and the SPN list returned by `setspn -L` differs from the `ServicePrincipalNames` attribute in `Get-ADServiceAccount` output for the same gMSA
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Re-register the missing SPNs manually; gMSA automatic password rollover can occasionally cause SPN registration to lag behind; verify with `Test-ADServiceAccount` and `setspn -L`
### K35 — FCI Node-Specific SPN Leak
- **Trigger:** Physical node hostnames of a Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) appear in `setspn -Q MSSQLSvc/*` results alongside the Virtual Network Name (VNN) SPN
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Remove SPNs registered against physical node names (`setspn -D MSSQLSvc/<node-name>:<port> DOMAIN\sqlsvc`); clients connecting to the physical node name may succeed with Kerberos while VNN connections fail, creating intermittent authentication failures after failover
### K36 — Distributed AG Forwarder Listener SPN Missing
- **Trigger:** A Distributed Availability Group (DAG) is described and the forwarder replica's listener name has no `MSSQLSvc/<forwarder-listener>:<port>` SPN registered — SQL 2016+
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Register `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<forwarder-listener-name>:<port> DOMAIN\sqlsvc` on each replica's service account; the forwarder introduces a second AG whose listener is an additional Kerberos target distinct from either underlying AG's listener
### K37 — TrustedToAuthForDelegation Set for an RBCD Path
- **Trigger:** Resource-based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) is in use (`msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` populated on the target) **and** `TrustedToAuthForDelegation` has been enabled on the initiating account to make protocol transition work. RBCD cannot use that bit: the KDC always allows protocol transition when performing RBCD, as though the bit were set. Setting it grants unnecessary protocol-transition privilege without affecting the RBCD path
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Clear the flag on the initiating account (`Set-ADUser <account> -TrustedToAuthForDelegation $false`) unless a separate classic-KCD path genuinely requires it — classic KCD (K23) does still need it. To control RBCD access by how the user authenticated, ACL the back-end service against the two well-known SIDs the KDC stamps into the ticket: `S-1-18-1` (`AUTHENTICATION_AUTHORITY_ASSERTED_IDENTITY`, client proved possession of its own credentials) and `S-1-18-2` (`SERVICE_ASSERTED_IDENTITY`, identity asserted by a service via protocol transition). See K41 before choosing RBCD for a linked-server path
### K38 — Encryption Type Mismatch Between Account and KDC Policy
- **Trigger:** The SQL Server service account's `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` bitmask does not intersect the encryption types the KDC will issue. Bit values: `0x4` (4) RC4-HMAC, `0x8` (8) AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96, `0x10` (16) AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96; `0x18` (24) is the hardened AES-only state and `0x1C` (28) the transitional RC4+AES state. Includes the Kerberos FAST armoring case, where DCs enforce armoring and the account holds no AES keys — Windows Server 2012+
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Set AES support on the account (`Set-ADUser <sqlsvc> -KerberosEncryptionType AES128,AES256`, or `Set-ADServiceAccount` for an MSA/gMSA). Confirm the resulting ticket type with `klist get MSSQLSvc/<fqdn>:1433` — a KDC that cannot satisfy the request returns `KDC_ERR_ETYPE_NOTSUPP` (`0xE`), also visible as the error code in KDC events 4768 and 4769. See K47 for the specific RC4-only case under AES enforcement
### K39 — Write-SPN Blocked by AdminSDHolder
- **Trigger:** The SQL Server service account's `ServicePrincipalName` attribute shows `DENY` on `Write ServicePrincipalName` or the account is a member of a privileged AD group (Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, etc.) — AdminSDHolder resets ACLs hourly via SDProp
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Move the SQL Server service account out of privileged AD groups (use a dedicated low-privilege domain account for SQL services); SDProp only resets ACLs on accounts in adminCount=1 groups; a dedicated service account is not subject to AdminSDHolder
### K40 — DNS CNAME Alias Without SPN
- **Trigger:** The connection string or client configuration references a DNS CNAME alias that resolves to the SQL Server host's A record, but no `MSSQLSvc/<cname>:<port>` SPN is registered for the alias name
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Register `setspn -S MSSQLSvc/<cname>:<port> DOMAIN\sqlsvc`; Kerberos ticket requests use the name from the client connection string, not the resolved A record; a CNAME alias requires its own SPN entry independent of the host's SPN

## Double-Hop Platform Constraints (K41–K44)

SQL Server features differ in which delegation models they support. Evaluate these before recommending KCD (K21) or RBCD (K24) for any double-hop, because the general advice is wrong for linked servers and for SSISDB.

### K41 — Linked Server Delegation Path Relies on RBCD
- **Trigger:** A linked-server double-hop is described (client → SQL A → linked server B) and the delegation path is built on Resource-Based Constrained Delegation — `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` populated on the target rather than `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` on the middle tier. Linked servers do not support RBCD in any version
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Rebuild the path on a supported model. Either classic constrained delegation on the middle-tier service account (`msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` listing the target's `MSSQLSvc` SPNs — requires SQL Server 2017 CU17 or later, see K42), or full delegation ("Trust this user for delegation to any service") on the middle-tier account where the version bar cannot be met. Clear the RBCD ACL on the target once the supported path works. Full delegation re-triggers K19, which is expected here — record the exception rather than reverting

### K42 — Linked Server Constrained Delegation Below SQL 2017 CU17
- **Trigger:** Constrained delegation is configured for a linked-server pass-through path but the middle-tier instance is older than SQL Server 2017 (14.x) CU17. Active Directory pass-through authentication over a linked server supported only full delegation before that build — SQL 2017 CU17+
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Patch the middle-tier instance to SQL Server 2017 CU17 or later, or switch that account to full delegation until you can. Confirm the build with `SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('ProductVersion')`. Symptom when unsupported: the second hop authenticates as `NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON` despite SPNs and delegation appearing correct

### K43 — SSISDB Package Double-Hop Under Constrained Delegation
- **Trigger:** An SSIS package stored in the SSISDB catalog is executed remotely and connects onward to a third machine, while the service account of the instance hosting SSISDB is configured for constrained delegation. SSISDB does not support constrained delegation — `ISServerExec.exe` cannot delegate the credentials onward
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Grant "Trust this user for delegation to any service (Kerberos Only)" to the SQL Server service account on the machine hosting SSISDB. This is a documented exception to K19: report both, and state that unconstrained delegation is required here rather than flagging it as a defect to remove. Where Windows Credential Guard is enabled it mandates constrained delegation, which makes the two requirements mutually exclusive — in that case move the package out of the SSISDB catalog (file system or MSDB deployment) or collapse the hop

### K44 — Named Instance Dynamic Port Prevents Kerberos
- **Trigger:** A named instance is left on its default dynamic-port configuration (`TCP Dynamic Ports` populated, `TCP Port` empty) in an environment that requires Kerberos. The port changes across restarts, so no port-form SPN stays valid. Distinct from K13 and K5, which cover a wrong port that is at least stable
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Pin a static port: SQL Server Configuration Manager → SQL Server Network Configuration → Protocols for the instance → TCP/IP → IP Addresses tab. If `Listen All` is `Yes`, clear `TCP Dynamic Ports` under `IPAll` and set `TCP Port`; if `No`, do the same for each enabled IP. Restart the instance, then register the SPN against that port. Kerberos Configuration Manager reports this condition explicitly as a Dynamic Port status

---

## Kerberos Environment Prerequisites (K45–K48)

Failures in this group produce the same symptoms as a broken SPN — NTLM fallback, SSPI errors, refused logins — while the SPN set is entirely correct. Evaluate them before concluding that SPN registration is the root cause.

### K45 — Clock Skew Beyond Kerberos Tolerance
- **Trigger:** The clock difference between the client or SQL Server host and the domain controller exceeds the Kerberos tolerance — see Thresholds Reference. Observable as `KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW`, or as event ID 4 with `KERB_AP_ERR_SKEW` in the System log
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Resynchronise the affected host against a domain controller in its own domain (`w32tm /resync /rediscover`, then `w32tm /stripchart` to confirm). Windows normally corrects drift automatically; manual action is needed when the clock is out by more than 48 hours, or when the host is not using a domain controller in its domain as its time source. For the forest, point the forest-root PDC emulator at a reliable external time source and let every other DC, member server and client inherit down the domain hierarchy

### K46 — Kerberos Token Size Exceeded
- **Trigger:** SQL Server logs error 17832, or a connecting principal's group membership is large enough that the Kerberos PAC exceeds `MaxTokenSize` — see Thresholds Reference. Estimate with `TokenSize = 1200 + 40d + 8s`, where `d` counts universal groups outside the account's domain plus `sIDHistory` SIDs, and `s` counts in-domain universal, domain-local and global group memberships
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Prefer reducing the token: rationalise group membership and clear stale `sIDHistory` entries left over from a forest migration. Where the registry must be raised, set `MaxTokenSize` under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters` on **every** machine in the authentication chain — client, any middle tier, and the SQL Server host — then restart each. Keep the value at or below 48000 where IIS is in the path, since IIS caps the HTTP request buffer at 64 KB and base64 expansion consumes the difference. Enable `Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\KDC\Warning for large Kerberos tickets` to get event ID 31 ahead of the failure

### K47 — RC4-Only Encryption Types Under AES Enforcement
- **Trigger:** The SQL Server service account resolves to RC4 only — `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` is `4`, or is unset while the KDC's `DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes` has been hardened to AES — in a domain where RC4 has been disabled. Ticket requests fail with `KDC_ERR_ETYPE_NOTSUPP` (`0xE`) in KDC events 4768 and 4769
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Set AES explicitly on the account rather than relying on the domain default: `Set-ADUser <sqlsvc> -KerberosEncryptionType AES128,AES256` (or `Set-ADServiceAccount` for MSA/gMSA), which corresponds to a bitmask of 24. Use 28 while RC4 is still needed as a transitional fallback. An account created before AES support and never password-reset holds no AES keys at all — reset the password to generate them. Read the current state with `Get-ADObject -Properties msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` and confirm the fix with `klist get MSSQLSvc/<fqdn>:1433`

### K48 — Client and Server Across a Forest Boundary
- **Trigger:** The connecting principal's domain and the SQL Server's domain are not the same domain and have no trust path, or sit in different forests. Kerberos for SQL Server requires client and server to be in the same Windows domain or in trusted domains
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Establish or repair the trust, or move the principal into a trusted domain. Where a trust exists but tickets still fail with an unsupported-etype error, the trust object itself may not advertise AES — set it with `ksetup /setenctypeattr <trustingdomain> AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96` on a DC in the trusted domain, and configure both sides of a two-way transitive trust. Note that classic KCD (K21) cannot cross a domain boundary at all; RBCD (K24) can

## SQL Server on Linux Kerberos (K49–K51)

SQL Server on Linux does not self-register SPNs. It authenticates from a keytab file referenced by `mssql-conf`, so the Windows checks above are supplemented by keytab state — SQL 2017+ on Linux.

### K49 — Keytab Not Configured in mssql-conf
- **Trigger:** SQL Server on Linux is joined to Active Directory but `network.kerberoskeytabfile` or `network.privilegedadaccount` is unset in `/var/opt/mssql/mssql.conf`, or `mssql-conf validate-ad-config` reports a failure
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Create the keytab (`/opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup-ad-keytab /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab <aduser>`, or `adutil keytab createauto -k <path> -p <port> -H <fqdn> -s MSSQLSvc`), then point the instance at it: `/opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set network.kerberoskeytabfile /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab` and `/opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set network.privilegedadaccount <aduser>`. Restart with `systemctl restart mssql-server` and re-run `validate-ad-config`. Register the SPNs separately with `adutil spn addauto -n <aduser> -s MSSQLSvc -H <fqdn> -p <port>` — omitting `-p` generates portless SPNs that only work on the default port

### K50 — Keytab Encryption Types Mismatch the AD Account
- **Trigger:** `klist -kte <keytab>` shows encryption types that do not intersect what the AD account and domain will issue, or the keytab contains only `arcfour-hmac` in a domain enforcing AES
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Recreate the keytab entries with an AES type the domain supports (`adutil keytab createauto ... -e aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96`), and enable **This account supports Kerberos AES 128/256 bit encryption** on the privileged AD account. `arcfour-hmac` is documented as weak and not recommended for production — carry it only during transition. Note that AD reads `operatingSystemVersion` when deciding whether a host understands AES: a Linux account reporting a major version below 6 has `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` ignored in favour of the domain assumption, which is a documented cause of RC4 tickets that setting the attribute alone will not fix. Related: K47

### K51 — Keytab File Ownership or Permissions Wrong
- **Trigger:** The keytab is not owned by the `mssql` user, or its mode grants access beyond owner and group read
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** `chown mssql /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab` and `chmod 440 /var/opt/mssql/secrets/mssql.keytab`. The keytab holds long-term key material equivalent to the service account password — a readable keytab is a credential disclosure, and one SQL Server cannot read stops Active Directory authentication entirely

---

## Client Driver and Service State (K52–K54)

### K52 — Legacy Provider Cannot Use Kerberos Over Named Pipes
- **Trigger:** The connection uses the legacy OLE DB provider (`SQLOLEDB`) or the legacy ODBC driver (`SQL Server`) over Named Pipes. Neither supports Kerberos on that protocol — they negotiate NTLM regardless of how correct the SPN set is
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Move the connection to TCP, which is preferred regardless of driver version, and/or migrate to a current driver (`MSOLEDBSQL` or ODBC Driver 17+). Confirm the result with `SELECT net_transport, auth_scheme FROM sys.dm_exec_connections`. Treat this as the explanation when `auth_scheme` is `NTLM`, `net_transport` is `Named pipe`, and every SPN check passes — it is a documented driver limitation, not an SPN defect. Related: K20

### K53 — Service Account Password Changed Without Service Restart
- **Trigger:** The SQL Server service account password was changed, or the account is locked out, and the service has not been restarted since. The service still holds the old long-term key, so ticket decryption fails — surfacing as "Cannot generate SSPI context" or `KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED`
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Confirm the account can sign in to Windows interactively with the current password and is not locked out, then restart the SQL Server service so it re-derives its key. `KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED` has more than one cause — rule out a duplicate SPN (K8) and a service account name that is not unique across the forest before settling on this one. gMSA and MSA accounts avoid the failure mode entirely, since Windows rotates and applies the password without a restart

### K54 — Report Server Missing RSWindowsNegotiate
- **Trigger:** A Reporting Services or Power BI Report Server double-hop is described and `RSWindowsNegotiate` is absent from, or not first in, the `<AuthenticationTypes>` section of `rsreportserver.config`. Without it the report server never negotiates Kerberos, so delegation cannot occur no matter how the SPNs and delegation attributes are set
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Add `<RSWindowsNegotiate />` as the first entry in `<AuthenticationTypes>`, then stop and restart the Report Server service from Report Server Configuration Manager. Pair with K17 — `RSWindowsNegotiate` without an `HTTP` SPN on a domain service account produces repeated credential prompts followed by an empty browser window. Where Kerberos is not required, the documented alternative is to remove `RSWindowsNegotiate` and leave only `RSWindowsNTLM`, which permits a domain service account with no SPN at all. For trace-log evidence of report server failures, see `/ssrstracelog-review`

## Version-Aware Check Suppression

If the SQL Server version is stated by the user, read `VERSION_COMPATIBILITY.md` (`~/.claude/skills/VERSION_COMPATIBILITY.md` if installed, or `skills/VERSION_COMPATIBILITY.md` from the repo). If unavailable, skip silently. For checks whose minimum version exceeds the instance version: verbose mode → log as `SKIP (version: requires SQL 20XX+, instance is SQL 20YY)`; standard report → omit entirely. Do not suppress `NOT ASSESSED` rows from missing input — only suppress version-inapplicable checks.

## Output Format

Structure the report as follows:

## Notes

- When `setspn -X` output is not provided, K8 (duplicate SPN) cannot be fully evaluated — state the limitation.
- When AD attribute output is absent, K19–K25 and K26–K30 may be partially or fully unevaluable — list each as SKIP with the missing data noted.
- Connection string hostname must match the SPN hostname character-for-character (case-insensitive); an alias, IP address, or CNAME resolving to the host does not satisfy the SPN requirement.
- SPN form depends on the protocol, not just the instance type. Over TCP, both default and named instances use `MSSQLSvc/<FQDN>:<port>`. Over a protocol other than TCP (named pipes, shared memory), the default instance uses `MSSQLSvc/<FQDN>` and a named instance uses `MSSQLSvc/<FQDN>:<instancename>`. The SQL Browser service resolves instance names to ports but is not involved in Kerberos ticket issuance.
- The Dedicated Administrator Connection (DAC) uses an instance-name-based SPN; Kerberos works over the DAC only when that SPN is registered, or when the account name is supplied as the SPN.
- FCI SPNs must use the VNN, not the physical node names; individual node SPNs are irrelevant to client connections.
- RBCD (K24) was introduced in Windows Server 2012 and works across domains, because the delegation is configured on the resource account rather than the front-end account. Classic KCD (K21) requires domain admin privileges to configure and restricts the account to a single domain — it cannot cross a domain or forest boundary.
- Delegation support is not uniform across SQL features. Linked servers do not support RBCD at all and need SQL Server 2017 CU17 or later for constrained delegation (K41, K42); SSISDB catalog execution does not support constrained delegation in any version (K43). Check those before recommending KCD or RBCD for a double-hop.
- A correct SPN set is necessary but not sufficient. Clock skew (K45), Kerberos token size (K46), account encryption types (K47) and forest topology (K48) each break Kerberos independently of SPN state.

## Output Filters (--brief / --critical-only)

**`--brief`** — Omit the Passed Checks table and attribution footer. Output the Summary, Findings, and Prioritized Action Order sections only. Use when a quick scan of what fired is all that's needed.

**`--critical-only`** — Suppress Warning and Info findings. Show only Critical findings. The Passed Checks table is also omitted. Use when triaging an incident and only actionable blockers matter.

Both flags can be combined: `--brief --critical-only` produces the Summary section plus Critical findings only.

When neither flag is present, produce the full report as documented above.

---

## Verbose Output (--verbose)

When the user's request includes `--verbose`, `--trace`, or the word `verbose`:

**1. Append a `## Check Evaluation Log` section** after the Passed Checks table.

Include one row for every check in this skill's ruleset, in check-ID order:

| Check | Evidence | Threshold | Result |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| [ID — Name] | [key attribute(s) and value found, or "absent"] | [threshold or condition] | PASS / **FIRE → [severity]** / NOT ASSESSED |

Result conventions:
- `PASS` — attribute present, threshold not met
- `**FIRE → Critical/Warning/Info**` — threshold met; bold to distinguish from passes
- `NOT ASSESSED` — required attribute absent from input

**2. Save both files** to the current working directory using the Write tool:

  output/<skill-name>/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss>-<input-prefix>/analysis.md  ← full report
  output/<skill-name>/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss>-<input-prefix>/trace.md     ← Check Evaluation Log

Derive `<input-prefix>`:
1. Filename stem if a file path was provided (e.g. `horrible.sqlplan` → `horrible`)
2. First meaningful identifier from the artifact (top wait type, first table name, procedure name, etc.)
3. Fallback: `run`
Sanitize: alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores only, max 32 chars.

File headers:
  analysis.md → `# Analysis — <skill-name> / # Input: <first 80 chars> / # Generated: <UTC timestamp>`
  trace.md    → `# Check Evaluation Log — <skill-name> / # Input: <first 80 chars> / # Generated: <UTC timestamp>`

Create directories as needed. When `--verbose` is not present, write nothing to disk.
