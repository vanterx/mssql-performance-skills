# SQL Server Procedure Stats Review Skill

## Purpose

Analyze runtime statistics collected from `sys.dm_exec_procedure_stats`,
`sys.dm_exec_trigger_stats`, and `sys.dm_exec_function_stats` into the `collect.proc_stats`
table. Applies 25 checks (R1–R25) across five categories:

- **R1–R5** — Top resource consumers: identify which procedure, trigger, or function is
  burning the most CPU, reads, or elapsed time in the collection interval
- **R6–R10** — Per-execution efficiency: flag objects that are expensive per call regardless
  of how often they run — high average CPU, high reads, parameter sniffing signals, spills
- **R11–R15** — Pattern detection: N+1 callers, chatty high-frequency procs, plan instability,
  workload concentration, infrequent-but-heavy outliers
- **R16–R20** — Trend analysis: worsening CPU/reads across snapshots, execution spikes,
  plan changes, new high-cost entries (requires ≥ 3 snapshots from Q5)
- **R21–R25** — Advanced runtime patterns: natively compiled proc regression, high CLR ratio,
  trigger-dominated elapsed time, parallel-to-serial regression, Query Store plan instability

## Input

Accept any of:

- **Q1 output** (Top CPU) — paste the result grid from `04_report_queries.sql` Query 1
- **Q2 output** (Top Reads) — paste Query 2 result grid
- **Q3 output** (Top Callers) — paste Query 3 result grid
- **Q4 output** (Per-Execution Averages) — paste Query 4 result grid
- **Q5 output** (Trend / Time Series) — paste Query 5 result grid (requires ≥ 3 snapshots)
- **Combined paste** — paste two or more query outputs together; apply all applicable checks
- **Natural language description** — describe the metrics you see ("usp_GetOrders uses 80% of CPU")
- **Statement-level stats** — paste output from `collect.query_stats` using the report query in
  `scripts/collection/12_report_all_collections.sql` Section 2; all R-checks apply equally to
  statement-level data — just note the object_name may be NULL for ad-hoc SQL

For trend checks (R16–R20), Q5 output with ≥ 3 rows per object is required. State
"Cannot evaluate R16–R20 — trend data not provided" if Q5 is absent.

## Statement-Level Checks (R1–R5): Top Resource Consumers

Run these first. They identify which objects dominate the workload in the collection interval.
### R1 — CPU Hotspot
- **Trigger:** `cpu_ms_per_sec` ≥ 50 for a single object, OR that object's `total_worker_time_delta` represents > 50% of the sum across all objects in the result set
- **Severity:** Warning if ≥ 50 ms/s or > 50%; Critical if ≥ 500 ms/s or > 80%
- **Fix:** Run `/sqlplan-review` on this procedure's cached plan to identify the expensive operator. Check for missing indexes, implicit conversions, or missing parallelism. Use `OPTION (RECOMPILE)` as immediate mitigation if parameter sniffing is suspected (see R9).
### R2 — Read Hotspot
- **Trigger:** `reads_per_sec` ≥ 5,000 for a single object, OR that object's `total_logical_reads_delta` represents > 50% of total reads in the result
- **Severity:** Warning if ≥ 5,000 reads/s or > 50%; Critical if ≥ 50,000 reads/s or > 80%
- **Fix:** The object reads disproportionately from the buffer pool. Run `/sqlplan-index-advisor` on its execution plan. High `avg_logical_reads` (see R7) indicates a per-execution index problem; high `reads_per_sec` with low `avg_logical_reads` indicates high frequency (see R4/R12).
### R3 — Duration Hotspot
- **Trigger:** `avg_elapsed_ms` ≥ 5,000 ms AND `execs_in_interval` > 0
- **Severity:** Warning if ≥ 5,000 ms; Critical if ≥ 30,000 ms
- **Fix:** Objects with high elapsed time are holding connections and blocking dependent code. If `avg_elapsed_ms` >> `avg_cpu_ms` (see R8 blocking signal), investigate locking with `/sqlwait-review` or `/sqlplan-deadlock`. If `avg_elapsed_ms` ≈ `avg_cpu_ms`, the work itself is expensive — run `/sqlplan-review`.
### R4 — Execution Frequency Hotspot
- **Trigger:** `execs_in_interval` ≥ 10,000 in a single collection window
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** A highly executed object deserves extra scrutiny even if per-execution cost is low. Total resource consumption is execution count × per-call cost. Pair with R11 (N+1) and R12 (chatty) checks to understand the caller pattern.
### R5 — Physical I/O Hotspot (Cache Miss)
- **Trigger:** `physical_reads_delta` > 0 AND `physical_pct` > 10% (more than 1 in 10 page reads goes to disk)
- **Severity:** Warning if `physical_pct` > 10%; Critical if > 50%
- **Fix:** Data is not in the buffer pool. Root causes: (1) insufficient memory — check `sys.dm_os_memory_clerks`; (2) scans reading cold data — add covering indexes; (3) first execution after cache flush — monitor over multiple windows to see if physical reads decline.

---

## Node-Level Checks (R6–R10): Per-Execution Efficiency

Apply these regardless of execution count — an infrequent but expensive proc matters.
### R6 — High Average CPU per Execution
- **Trigger:** `avg_cpu_ms` ≥ 1,000 ms
- **Severity:** Warning if ≥ 1,000 ms; Critical if ≥ 10,000 ms
- **Fix:** The object does significant work per call. Capture its actual execution plan (`SET STATISTICS TIME ON` or SSMS actual plan) and run `/sqlplan-review`. Focus on the highest-cost operator. Common causes: full table scans from missing indexes, sort spills, hash join spills, large row sets.
### R7 — High Average Reads per Execution
- **Trigger:** `avg_logical_reads` ≥ 50,000 per execution
- **Severity:** Warning if ≥ 50,000; Critical if ≥ 500,000
- **Fix:** The object reads many buffer pool pages per call. At 8 KB per page, 50,000 reads = 400 MB of data touched per execution. Run `/sqlplan-index-advisor` on its plan to generate covering index DDL. Check for table scans, key lookups, and missing WHERE clause indexes.
### R8 — CPU-Elapsed Skew (Parallelism Waste or Blocking Signal)
- **Trigger:**
  - `cpu_to_elapsed_ratio` > 1.5: CPU > elapsed → object uses parallelism, but threads may be poorly utilized (CXPACKET waits)
  - `cpu_to_elapsed_ratio` < 0.2: elapsed >> CPU → most time is waiting, not executing (blocking, lock waits, I/O)
- **Severity:** Warning if ratio > 1.5 or < 0.2; Critical if > 3.0 or < 0.05
- **Fix (parallel waste):** Run `/sqlplan-review` and check N27 (thread skew) and S8 (ineffective parallelism). Consider reducing MAXDOP.
- **Fix (blocking/IO):** Run `/sqlwait-review` to identify the dominant wait type. If `PAGEIOLATCH`, investigate missing indexes. If `LCK_M_*`, investigate blocking chains or isolation level.
### R9 — Max vs Average CPU Skew (Parameter Sniffing Signal)
- **Trigger:** `max_to_avg_cpu_ratio` ≥ 10 (worst single execution used 10× the average CPU)
- **Severity:** Info if ≥ 3; Warning if ≥ 10; Critical if ≥ 100
- **Fix:** The plan was compiled for one parameter set but executed with a very different set. The worst execution was dramatically more expensive than the average. Add `OPTION (RECOMPILE)` as immediate mitigation. Long term: use `OPTION (OPTIMIZE FOR)`, filtered statistics, or a plan guide. Run `/sqlplan-review` on the bad-parameter plan.
### R10 — High Spills per Execution
- **Trigger:** `avg_spills` ≥ 1 (the object spills to TempDb on average at least once per execution)
- **Severity:** Warning if ≥ 1; Critical if ≥ 10
- **Fix:** The sort or hash operators inside the procedure are spilling to TempDb on most executions. This is usually caused by underestimated row counts (stale statistics or parameter sniffing). Run `/sqlplan-review` and look for N6 (sort spill risk) or N7 (hash spill risk). Update statistics and fix cardinality errors.

---

## Pattern Checks (R11–R15): Behavioral Patterns
### R11 — N+1 Caller Pattern
- **Trigger:** `execs_in_interval` ≥ 1,000 AND `avg_logical_reads` < 100 AND `avg_cpu_ms` < 10
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** A lightweight procedure called thousands of times per interval — a classic N+1 pattern. Each call is cheap but the aggregate load is high. Look for application-layer loops calling this procedure once per record. Rewrite to accept a table-valued parameter (TVP) or use `IN (...)` to batch the calls. Check `cpu_ms_per_sec` — even cheap procs at high frequency add up.
### R12 — Chatty High-Frequency Procedure
- **Trigger:** `execs_per_sec` ≥ 10 (10 or more executions every second)
- **Severity:** Warning if ≥ 10/s; Critical if ≥ 100/s
- **Fix:** The procedure is called extremely frequently. Even with low per-call cost, plan cache lookups, lock acquisitions, and connection overhead add up. Evaluate: (1) Can calls be batched (TVP or set-based)? (2) Can results be cached at the application layer? (3) Is there a missing index that makes each call look up one row when it could be a set?
### R13 — Plan Instability / Frequent Recompile Signal
- **Trigger:** Multiple rows in the result set share the same `database_name` + `object_name` but have different `plan_handle` values, AND `cache_age_minutes` for at least one row is < 60
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** The procedure's plan is being recompiled or evicted frequently. Common causes: `WITH RECOMPILE` on the procedure definition, `OPTION (RECOMPILE)` on inner statements, schema changes, statistics updates mid-execution, or SET option mismatches from different callers. Run `DBCC FREEPROCCACHE` monitoring or Extended Events to capture the recompile reason.
### R14 — Workload Concentration
- **Trigger:** The top object in the result accounts for > 50% of total `total_worker_time_delta` across all rows in the result set, OR the top 3 account for > 90%
- **Severity:** Info if top 3 > 70%; Warning if top 1 > 50%; Warning if top 3 > 90%
- **Fix:** The workload is concentrated on a small number of objects. This is common and not inherently a problem — but it means tuning R1/R2/R6/R7 on the top object will have outsized impact. It also means if that object fails or degrades, the entire server is affected. Consider read-scale, caching, or workload distribution.
### R15 — Infrequent but Expensive
- **Trigger:** `execs_in_interval` ≤ 5 AND `avg_logical_reads` ≥ 100,000
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** The object runs rarely but is extremely expensive per call — likely a batch job, report, or maintenance procedure. Even at low frequency, a 500,000-read execution blocks the buffer pool for other queries. Optimize with covering indexes (see R7), or schedule during off-peak hours with Resource Governor to cap its memory and CPU impact.

## Trend Checks (R16–R20): Requires Q5 Time-Series Output

Skip these checks and state "Cannot evaluate R16–R20 — Q5 trend data not provided" if
the input does not contain multiple rows per object across different `collection_time` values.
### R16 — Worsening CPU Trend
- **Trigger:** `avg_cpu_ms` or `cpu_ms_per_sec` increases monotonically across ≥ 3 consecutive snapshots for the same object
- **Severity:** Info (2 snapshots worsening); Warning (≥ 3 consecutive)
- **Fix:** The procedure is getting slower over time. Causes: (1) data growth making plans suboptimal — rebuild indexes and update statistics; (2) plan regression from statistics update — use Query Store to identify and force the prior good plan; (3) application change increasing workload per call — instrument with `SET STATISTICS IO, TIME ON`.
### R17 — Execution Rate Spike
- **Trigger:** `execs_in_interval` for the most recent snapshot > 2× the mean of prior snapshots for the same object
- **Severity:** Warning if > 2× mean; Critical if > 5× mean
- **Fix:** Something caused a sudden surge in call frequency — a batch job, application retry loop, or viral traffic. Identify the caller from `sys.dm_exec_sessions` or Extended Events. Check for application loops triggered by errors (error → retry → error spiral). Reduce call frequency or add circuit-breaker logic.
### R18 — Read Regression
- **Trigger:** `avg_logical_reads` increases by > 50% between the oldest and newest snapshot for the same object
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** The procedure is reading more pages per execution than it used to. Common causes: (1) plan regression — capture before/after plans with `/sqlplan-compare`; (2) data growth making a seek read more rows; (3) index dropped or disabled. Compare `plan_handle` across snapshots (see R20 — if it changed, the plan regressed).
### R19 — New High-Cost Entry
- **Trigger:** An object appears in the result for the first time (no prior rows in the time window) AND `cpu_ms_per_sec` ≥ 50 OR `avg_logical_reads` ≥ 50,000
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** A new or previously-idle procedure appeared with high resource usage. This may indicate: (1) a newly deployed stored procedure; (2) a batch job that started running; (3) a procedure that was previously executing cheaply but now has a bad plan. Capture its execution plan and run `/sqlplan-review`.
### R20 — Plan Instability Signal (Trend)
- **Trigger:** The same `database_name` + `object_name` shows different `plan_handle` values across consecutive snapshots in the trend output
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** The execution plan changed during the monitoring window — plan recompilation, cache eviction, or statistics update triggered a new plan. Check whether `avg_cpu_ms` or `avg_logical_reads` worsened after the plan change (correlate with R16/R18). If so, this is a plan regression — use Query Store to force the prior plan while investigating the root cause.

## Advanced Runtime Pattern Checks (R21–R25)

### R21 — Natively Compiled Proc Regression
- **Trigger:** A procedure with `object_name` that exists in `sys.sql_modules` with `EXECUTE AS` and is stored in a memory-optimized filegroup shows `avg_cpu_ms` increasing by ≥ 100% across snapshots — SQL 2014+ (In-Memory OLTP)
- **Severity:** Warning — natively compiled procedures are expected to be extremely fast (sub-millisecond); CPU increase signals schema change, statistics shift, or lock contention on memory-optimized tables
- **Fix:** Recompile the procedure: `EXEC sp_recompile N'schema.proc'`. Check for schema changes to underlying memory-optimized tables. Verify that `SCHEMA_AND_DATA` binding is intact and no new row-version contention has emerged. Compare STATISTICS IO output for the proc before and after the regression.

### R22 — High CLR Assembly Execution Ratio
- **Trigger:** A procedure's `total_clr_time_ms / total_elapsed_ms ≥ 40%` — indicates CLR assembly code dominates execution time
- **Severity:** Warning — CLR integration is not always slower than T-SQL, but a ratio ≥ 40% of elapsed time warrants review; CLR assemblies bypass the query optimizer and can mask inefficient .NET code paths
- **Fix:** Profile the CLR assembly itself (if source is available) using Visual Studio or dotnet-trace. If the CLR assembly performs I/O, consider moving that logic to T-SQL with indexed access. Evaluate whether the CLR function can be replaced by a built-in SQL Server function introduced in a later version (e.g., STRING_SPLIT, OPENJSON, STRING_AGG).

### R23 — Trigger Dominating Proc Elapsed Time
- **Trigger:** Cross-referencing `sys.dm_exec_trigger_stats` with `sys.dm_exec_procedure_stats` reveals that a trigger's `total_elapsed_ms` is ≥ 50% of the DML procedure's `total_elapsed_ms` on the same table
- **Severity:** Warning — triggers add invisible overhead to DML; their cost does not appear in the procedure's own DMV entry and is often overlooked during tuning
- **Fix:** Identify triggers on the table: `SELECT * FROM sys.triggers WHERE parent_id = OBJECT_ID('schema.table')`. Run the trigger body through `/tsql-review` and capture its execution plan. Consider whether trigger logic can be moved to the application layer or batched asynchronously (e.g., via Service Broker or a background job).

### R24 — Parallel Proc Became Serial (CPU/Elapsed Ratio Drop)
- **Trigger:** The same procedure shows `avg_cpu_ms / avg_elapsed_ms` ratio decreasing from ≥ 1.5 to ≤ 1.0 across consecutive snapshots — signals transition from a parallel to a serial plan
- **Severity:** Warning — a parallel plan becoming serial is a plan regression; elapsed time typically increases while CPU drops, indicating lost parallelism
- **Fix:** Check Query Store for plan changes: `SELECT * FROM sys.query_store_plan WHERE query_id = (SELECT query_id FROM sys.query_store_query WHERE query_hash = 0x<hash>)`. If a MAXDOP change, statistics update, or schema change caused the plan regression, use Query Store to force the parallel plan. Run `/sqlplan-review` on both plans to confirm the DOP change (check S7, N30).

### R25 — QS Plan Instability Correlated to Procstats Variance
- **Trigger:** A procedure appears in Query Store `sys.query_store_plan` with ≥ 3 distinct plans AND `avg_cpu_ms` variance between proc_stats snapshots is ≥ 50% — SQL 2016+ (Query Store)
- **Severity:** Warning — high variance in proc stats correlated with multiple Query Store plans indicates parameter-sensitive or plan-cache-churn behavior; each plan change risks a performance cliff
- **Fix:** Force the best plan in Query Store: `EXEC sys.sp_query_store_force_plan @query_id = <id>, @plan_id = <id>`. Investigate why plans are changing: statistics updates, ad-hoc parameter values, or RECOMPILE hints. Use `/query-store-review` (Q7–Q12) for full plan instability analysis.

## Version-Aware Check Suppression

If the SQL Server version is stated by the user, read `VERSION_COMPATIBILITY.md` (`~/.claude/skills/VERSION_COMPATIBILITY.md` if installed, or `skills/VERSION_COMPATIBILITY.md` from the repo). If unavailable, skip silently. For checks whose minimum version exceeds the instance version: verbose mode → log as `SKIP (version: requires SQL 20XX+, instance is SQL 20YY)`; standard report → omit entirely. Do not suppress `NOT ASSESSED` rows from missing input — only suppress version-inapplicable checks.

---

## Output Format

Structure your report as follows. Follow every formatting rule below exactly — the reference
output in `skills/procstats-review/examples/proc_stats_output-analysis.md` demonstrates the expected
quality level.

### Section: Input Summary

```
## Procedure Stats Analysis

### Input Summary
- Source: collect.proc_stats — [Q1 / Q2 / Q3 / Q4 / Q5] output
- Sample window: N minutes (sample_seconds = X)
- Collection time: [collection_time from data]
- Objects in result: N (PROCEDURE: N, TRIGGER: N, FUNCTION: N)
- Trend snapshots: N  [or "N/A — single snapshot"]
```

---

### Section: Top Resource Consumers Table

Always include this table, populated from whatever input was provided:

```
### Top Resource Consumers

| Rank | Object | Type | DB | Execs | CPU ms/s | Avg CPU ms | Avg Reads | Reads/s |
|------|--------|------|----|-------|----------|------------|-----------|---------|
| 1    | ...    | PROC | .. | ...   | ...      | ...        | ...       | ...     |
```

---

### Section: Findings (Critical → Warnings → Info)

Each finding **must** include the check ID that fired:

```
### [C1 — R6] High Average CPU — dbo.usp_GetOrderHistory (avg 12,400 ms)
- **Observed:** avg_cpu_ms = 12,400, execs_in_interval = 48, cpu_ms_per_sec = 99.2
- **Impact:** [why this matters at runtime]
- **Fix:** [concrete action]
```

- **Object names in finding headers and Observed lines must use `schema_name.object_name`
  format when `schema_name` is present in the input.** Use bare `object_name` only when
  `schema_name` is NULL (ad-hoc SQL with no associated object).
  Correct: `dbo.usp_GetSalesReport` — Wrong: `usp_GetSalesReport`
- Findings reference each other by ID where one explains another (e.g. "root cause of C1").
- Parameter sniffing findings (R9) go in Info unless `max_to_avg_cpu_ratio` ≥ 10 (Warning).

---

### Section: Prioritized Action Order

Always end the findings with this table:

```
### Prioritized Action Order

| Priority | Action | Resolves | Effort |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 — Immediately | Run /sqlplan-review on dbo.usp_GetOrderHistory | C1, W2 | 15 min |
| 2 — Today        | Add covering index on Orders(CustomerId) | W2 | 30 min |
```

---

### Section: Passed Checks

Format as a two-column table. Include every check explicitly evaluated and not triggered.

```
### Passed Checks

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| R1 — CPU Hotspot | PASS — no object > 50% of total CPU delta (top proc = 34%) |
| R5 — Physical I/O | PASS — physical_reads_delta = 0 across all objects |

---
*Analyzed by: [state the AI model and version you are running as, e.g. "Claude Sonnet 4.6", "DeepSeek R1", "GPT-4o"] · [current date and time in the user's local timezone, or UTC if timezone is unknown, e.g. "2026-05-16 20:15 NZST"]*
```

---

## Notes

- When only Q1 or Q2 output is provided, checks R11–R15 that require execution count + per-exec
  averages together may not be fully evaluable — state the limitation explicitly.
- When Q5 trend data is absent, state "Cannot evaluate R16–R20" rather than skipping silently.
- Do not invent findings not triggered by the rules above.
- `total_worker_time` is cumulative microseconds in the DMV; `avg_worker_time_ms` is already
  converted to milliseconds in the report queries — do not double-convert.
- `avg_spills` = NULL means the SQL Server version does not support `total_spills`
  (pre-2017) — skip R10 and note the version limitation.

---

### Section: Output Filters (--brief / --critical-only)

**`--brief`** — Omit the Passed Checks table and attribution footer. Output the Summary, Findings, and Prioritized Fix Sequence sections only. Use when a quick scan of what fired is all that's needed.

**`--critical-only`** — Suppress Warning and Info findings. Show only Critical findings. The Passed Checks table is also omitted. Use when triaging an incident and only actionable blockers matter.

Both flags can be combined: `--brief --critical-only` produces the Summary section plus Critical findings only.

When neither flag is present, produce the full report as documented above.

---

### Section: Verbose Output (--verbose)

When the user's request includes `--verbose`, `--trace`, or the word `verbose`:

**1. Append a `## Check Evaluation Log` section** after the Passed Checks table.

Include one row for every check in this skill's ruleset, in check-ID order:

| Check | Evidence | Threshold | Result |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| [ID — Name] | [key attribute(s) and value found, or "absent"] | [threshold or condition] | PASS / **FIRE → [severity]** / NOT ASSESSED |

Result conventions:
- `PASS` — attribute present, threshold not met
- `**FIRE → Critical/Warning/Info**` — threshold met; bold to distinguish from passes
- `NOT ASSESSED` — required attribute absent from input

**2. Save both files** to the current working directory using the Write tool:

  output/<skill-name>/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss>-<input-prefix>/analysis.md  ← full report
  output/<skill-name>/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss>-<input-prefix>/trace.md     ← Check Evaluation Log

Derive `<input-prefix>`:
1. Filename stem if a file path was provided (e.g. `horrible.sqlplan` → `horrible`)
2. First meaningful identifier from the artifact (top wait type, first table name, procedure name, etc.)
3. Fallback: `run`
Sanitize: alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores only, max 32 chars.

File headers:
  analysis.md → `# Analysis — <skill-name> / # Input: <first 80 chars> / # Generated: <UTC timestamp>`
  trace.md    → `# Check Evaluation Log — <skill-name> / # Input: <first 80 chars> / # Generated: <UTC timestamp>`

Create directories as needed. When `--verbose` is not present, write nothing to disk.
