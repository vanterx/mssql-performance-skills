# SQL Server Statistics IO/Time Review Skill

## Purpose

Parse raw `SET STATISTICS IO, TIME ON` output from SQL Server Management Studio and produce a structured report of I/O activity and timing per statement. Applies 22 checks across IO patterns (I1–I15) and time patterns (W1–W7) to surface performance concerns that the raw output obscures.

This is the IO/time complement to `sqlplan-review`. Run it when you have STATISTICS output but no execution plan, or alongside the plan to cross-reference what actually happened at the I/O layer.

## Input

Accept any of:
- Raw SSMS console output pasted inline (everything after `SET STATISTICS IO, TIME ON`)
- A plain-text `.txt` file path containing the console output
- A description of what the output showed ("physical reads on Orders table, 140ms elapsed")

The input may contain mixed content — IO lines, time lines, rows-affected messages, error messages, and unrelated output. Parse only the recognized patterns; preserve unrecognized lines as informational context.

## Supported Input Line Formats

### STATISTICS IO line
```
Table 'TableName'. Scan count X, logical reads Y, physical reads Z, read-ahead reads A, lob logical reads B, lob physical reads C, lob read-ahead reads D.
```

Optional additional fields (appear in Azure SQL or columnstore workloads):
- `page server reads` — Azure SQL Hyperscale: reads from page server (remote storage)
- `page server read-ahead reads` — Azure SQL Hyperscale prefetch
- `lob page server reads`, `lob page server read-ahead reads`
- `segment reads`, `segment skipped` — columnstore index segment elimination

Special table names: `Worktable` (hash/sort spill), `Workfile` (hash spill), names starting with `#` (explicit temp tables).

### STATISTICS TIME lines
```
SQL Server parse and compile time:
   CPU time = 108 ms, elapsed time = 108 ms.

SQL Server Execution Times:
   CPU time = 156527 ms,  elapsed time = 284906 ms.
```

### Rows affected
```
(13431682 row(s) affected)
```

### Error messages
```
Msg 207, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
Invalid column name 'scores'.
```

### Completion timestamp
```
Completion time: 2025-05-27T10:32:37.8122685-04:00
```

## How to Run

1. **Parse**: Split input on newlines. Classify each line as: IO, ExecutionTime, CompileTime, RowsAffected, Error, CompletionTime, or Info.
2. **Group into statements**: Consecutive IO lines belong to the same statement group. A non-IO line (time, rows-affected, error) separates groups.
3. **Compute per-statement totals**: Sum all IO metrics within each statement group. Compute `% Logical Reads` for each table: `(table_logical / group_total_logical) × 100` to 3 decimal places. If total logical = 0, leave blank.
4. **Detect summary time rows**: If a time row's elapsed ≈ (compile_elapsed + execution_elapsed) ± 5 ms, mark it as a summary row and exclude it from running totals. Note: "Summary row detected — not added to totals."
5. **Compute grand totals**: Accumulate IO metrics across all statement groups. Merge rows for the same table name. Sort the grand total table alphabetically by table name.
6. **Run checks I1–I15 and W1–W7**: Evaluate each check against parsed data. Report triggered checks in the findings section.
7. **Output**: Produce the structured report defined in Output Format.

## IO Checks (I1–I15)

Evaluate per-statement and per-table IO metrics.
### I1 — High Logical Read Count
- **Trigger:** Statement total `logical reads` ≥ 1,000,000 (warning) or ≥ 10,000,000 (critical)
- **Severity:** Warning (≥ 1 M); Critical (≥ 10 M)
- **Fix:** High logical reads indicate large data volumes scanned. Find the highest-% table and add a covering index to reduce reads. Run `/sqlplan-review` on the execution plan for operator-level detail.
### I2 — Excessive Scan Count
- **Trigger:** Any single table has `scan count` ≥ 1,000 (warning) or ≥ 10,000 (critical)
- **Severity:** Warning (1 000–9 999); Critical (≥ 10 000)
- **Fix:** High scan count on the inner side of a Nested Loops join. Add an index on the join/seek column of the scanned table so each iteration can seek instead of scan. Confirm with `/sqlplan-review` (N5 Key Lookup, N4 Expensive Scan).
### I3 — High Physical Read Ratio
- **Trigger:** Any table where `physical reads / logical reads ≥ 10%`
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Pages not in the buffer pool. Expected on cold cache (first run after restart or DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS). Concerning on a warm system: indicates the working set is larger than available RAM, or this table is infrequently accessed. Solutions: add RAM, reduce logical reads via index, or pre-warm the buffer pool.
### I4 — Read-Ahead Dominant Pattern (Full Scan Signal)
- **Trigger:** `read-ahead reads / logical reads ≥ 80%` AND `logical reads ≥ 10,000` for any table
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** The storage engine prefetched most pages sequentially — strong indicator of a full index scan. Verify whether an index seek is possible for this table's predicate (`/tsql-review` T4, T6; `/sqlplan-review` N4).
### I5 — Single Table Dominates Logical Reads
- **Trigger:** One table accounts for ≥ 80% (warning) or ≥ 95% (critical) of statement total logical reads
- **Severity:** Warning (≥ 80%); Critical (≥ 95%)
- **Fix:** Focus all index tuning effort on this table. A covering index eliminating a scan or key lookup here has the highest marginal impact. Run `/sqlplan-review` and `/sqlplan-index-advisor` targeted at this table.
### I6 — Worktable or Workfile Detected
- **Trigger:** Table name is exactly `Worktable` or `Workfile`
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** SQL Server created a temporary work structure in `tempdb` for an in-memory sort or hash join that exceeded its memory grant. This corresponds to a spill to tempdb — see checks N41–N43 in `sqlplan-review`. Reduce spills by: updating statistics, adding indexes to avoid large sorts, or increasing the memory grant via `OPTION (MIN_GRANT_PERCENT)`.
### I7 — Temporary Table in IO Output
- **Trigger:** Table name starts with `#` (explicit local temp table) or `##` (global temp table)
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** An explicit temp table is being used. Verify it has adequate statistics (created after INSERT, not before) and appropriate indexes for subsequent joins. See `/tsql-review` T45, T46 for table variable vs temp table guidance.
### I8 — LOB Reads Present
- **Trigger:** `lob logical reads > 0` for any table
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** The query is accessing Large Object columns (text, ntext, image, varchar(max), nvarchar(max), xml, or json). LOB pages are stored separately from the main row and require additional I/O. Consider: reading only the needed LOB columns (replace SELECT *), or restructuring JSON/XML access.
### I9 — LOB Reads Dominant
- **Trigger:** `lob logical reads / logical reads ≥ 50%` for any table
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Most I/O for this table is LOB data. The LOB columns are likely large or numerous. Investigate: reading fewer LOB columns, compressing LOB data, or moving infrequently-accessed LOB data to a separate table.
### I10 — Columnstore Segment Skip Rate Low
- **Trigger:** `segment skipped / (segment reads + segment skipped) < 50%` when segment data is present
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Less than half of columnstore segments were skipped — the query predicate is not eliminating segments effectively. Segment elimination relies on min/max metadata per segment. Solutions: reorganize the columnstore index to improve segment clustering (rebuild, or add a clustered rowstore index to order data before loading), or add a more selective predicate.
### I11 — Columnstore Segment Skip Rate High (Good Pattern)
- **Trigger:** `segment skipped / (segment reads + segment skipped) ≥ 90%` when segment data is present
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** 90%+ of columnstore segments were skipped — excellent predicate selectivity at the storage layer. No action required. Document this as a well-tuned columnstore query.
### I12 — Same Table Appears Multiple Times in Statement
- **Trigger:** The same table name appears more than once in a single statement's IO group
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** The table was scanned or accessed multiple times in the same query. Common causes: a CTE referenced more than once (T24), multiple joins to the same table, or a subquery materializing separately. Use `/sqlplan-review` to confirm the operator topology.
### I13 — Zero Rows Affected With High Reads
- **Trigger:** Statement has `rows affected = 0` AND total `logical reads ≥ 10,000`
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** The query performed substantial I/O but modified or returned no rows. Possible causes: filter predicate too restrictive (all data read then filtered out), or a WHERE clause that prevents index seeks (T4, T6). Verify predicate selectivity and index coverage.
### I14 — Physical Reads Non-Zero on Warm System
- **Trigger:** Any table has `physical reads > 0`
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** Physical reads indicate pages read from disk rather than the buffer pool cache. On a system that has been running normally (warm cache), persistent physical reads may signal buffer pool pressure (insufficient RAM for working set). Benign on first execution or after cache flush.
### I15 — Azure SQL Page Server Reads Detected
- **Trigger:** `page server reads > 0` for any table
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** Running on Azure SQL Hyperscale — page server reads are reads from remote storage (page server), not the local buffer pool. Similar in impact to physical reads. Optimize by reducing total logical reads to improve local cache hit rate.

## Time Checks (W1–W7)

Evaluate CPU and elapsed time metrics per statement.
### W1 — I/O or Lock Wait Dominant (CPU << Elapsed)
- **Trigger:** `execution_cpu < 10% of execution_elapsed` AND elapsed ≥ 1,000 ms
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** The query spent most of its elapsed time waiting, not computing. Common causes: physical I/O (check I3, I14), lock/latch waits (blocking from concurrent queries), or network transfer time. If physical reads are low, investigate lock waits using `sys.dm_exec_requests` or Extended Events.
### W2 — Parallel Execution Detected (CPU >> Elapsed)
- **Trigger:** `execution_cpu > 150% of execution_elapsed`
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** CPU time exceeds elapsed time — the query ran on multiple threads (parallel plan). CPU time is the sum across all threads. This is expected and often desirable. Use `/sqlplan-review` to confirm DOP and check for thread imbalance (N30 Parallel Thread Skew).
### W3 — High Compile Time Relative to Execution
- **Trigger:** `compile_cpu > 20% of execution_cpu` AND `compile_elapsed ≥ 200 ms`
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Query compilation consumed a significant fraction of the total time. Causes: complex query structure (deep CTEs T25, many joins), missing statistics, or ad-hoc queries that aren't cached. Fix: simplify the query, ensure statistics are up to date, or use a stored procedure to enable plan reuse.
### W4 — Long Elapsed Time
- **Trigger:** `execution_elapsed ≥ 30,000 ms` (warning) or ≥ 300,000 ms (critical)
- **Severity:** Warning (≥ 30 s); Critical (≥ 5 min)
- **Fix:** Query ran for > 30 seconds. Prioritize for tuning. Identify the highest-read table (I1, I5) and run `/sqlplan-review` on the captured execution plan to find the dominant operator.
### W5 — High CPU Time
- **Trigger:** `execution_cpu ≥ 60,000 ms`
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Query consumed > 60 seconds of CPU time. High CPU usually correlates with large scans, sorts, hash joins, or implicit conversions. Use `/sqlplan-review` to identify the high-CPU operators (N4 Scan, N18 Hash Match, N20 Sort).
### W6 — Multi-Batch: Highly Variable Elapsed Times
- **Trigger:** When multiple statements are present, `max(execution_elapsed) > 10× min(execution_elapsed)` for statements with elapsed ≥ 100 ms
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** One or more statements take dramatically longer than others. Focus tuning effort on the slowest batch. Report which statement number is the outlier.
### W7 — High Rows Affected With Low Elapsed
- **Trigger:** `rows_affected > 1,000,000` AND `execution_elapsed < 10,000 ms`
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** Query modified > 1 million rows very quickly. Verify this was intentional. Large-volume DML may: fill the transaction log, cause long-running lock hold, or affect downstream replication. Consider batching (e.g., `TOP 10000` in a loop).

*Analyzed by: [state the AI model and version you are running as, e.g. "Claude Sonnet 4.6", "DeepSeek R1", "GPT-4o"] · [current date and time in the user's local timezone, or UTC if timezone is unknown, e.g. "2026-05-16 20:15 NZST"]*
```

**Formatting rules:**
- Time values: display as both raw ms and `hh:mm:ss.mmm` format
- All numeric IO values: comma-formatted thousands separators
- % Logical Reads: 3 decimal places for per-statement tables; 1 decimal place for grand totals
- Omit LOB, segment, and page server columns from tables if all values are zero
- Bold the totals row in every table
- If no execution time line is found for a statement, note "No execution time recorded"
- If compile time appears without execution time (compile-only run), note it

---

## Notes

- Finding headers include the statement number and table name as the source reference (e.g., `[C1 — Stmt 2, Table 'Orders']`). For single-statement inputs, use the table name alone (e.g., `[C1 — Table 'Orders']`).
- Do not invent findings not triggered by the rules above.
- `Worktable` and `Workfile` are system-generated names; do not treat them as user tables in grand totals sorting, but do include their reads in totals.
- A compile time row that appears between two batches is a *batch separator* — assign it to the preceding batch's compile phase.
- When rows affected is singular "1 row affected" vs plural, handle both forms.
- If the same statement produces both compile time and execution time lines, the compile line precedes the execution line — maintain this ordering in the report.
- For very long inputs (> 50 statements), summarize the per-statement section and focus on grand totals and the top 5 statements by logical reads.
- Summary time rows (where elapsed ≈ compile + execution totals) must not be double-counted. Note their detection explicitly.

## Companion Skills

- **tsql-review** — Review the T-SQL source code of the query for static anti-patterns (non-sargable predicates, cursor loops, dynamic SQL) before the query runs.
- **sqlplan-review** — Analyze the execution plan for the same query to understand operator choices, join strategies, and row estimate quality that drove the I/O seen in STATISTICS output.
- **sqlplan-index-advisor** — Derive `CREATE INDEX` recommendations from the execution plan to reduce the logical reads identified here.
- **sqlplan-deadlock** — If high I/O correlates with long elapsed times and low CPU (W1), investigate deadlock or blocking as a root cause.
- **sqlplan-batch** — If you have `.sqlplan` files for the same workload, batch-analyze them alongside this STATISTICS review.
- **query-store-review** — Analyze Query Store data to find regressed queries, plan instability, and the top resource consumers across the whole workload. Use after running a workload capture to prioritize which queries to tune with /sqlplan-review.

- **mssql-performance-review** — Orchestrator that routes mixed artifacts to multiple specialised skills (this one included), runs an adversarial root-cause check, and produces a single consolidated report with evidence chain, risk-rated fixes, and rollback. Use when you have several artifact types together or describe a symptom without knowing which skill to run.
