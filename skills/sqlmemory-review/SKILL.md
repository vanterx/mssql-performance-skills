# SQL Server Memory Review Skill

## Purpose

Analyze SQL Server memory state and identify the root cause of memory pressure. Applies 20 checks (O1–O20) across four categories:

- **O1–O5** — Buffer pool and Page Life Expectancy: detect low PLE, declining trends, NUMA node imbalance, and buffer pool concentration in a single database
- **O6–O10** — Plan cache: single-use plan bloat, excessive compile counts, large individual plans, and high plan cache churn
- **O11–O15** — Memory grants and RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE: detect grant queuing, grant timeouts, oversized grants, and Resource Governor misconfigurations
- **O16–O20** — Memory clerks, OS pressure, and configuration: ColumnStore/In-Memory OLTP memory footprint, OS pressure notifications, stolen (non-buffer) memory dominance, Lock Pages in Memory misconfiguration, and Max Server Memory not explicitly set

## Input

Accept any of:
- Output from `sys.dm_os_memory_clerks` capture query below (paste the result grid)
- Output from `sys.dm_os_ring_buffers` WHERE `ring_buffer_type = N'RING_BUFFER_RESOURCE_MONITOR'` — memory pressure notifications (also accept `RING_BUFFER_OOM` records for out-of-memory events)
- Output from `sys.dm_exec_query_memory_grants` for current grant queue state
- PLE counter values from `sys.dm_os_performance_counters` or SSMS Activity Monitor
- Output from `sys.dm_os_sys_memory` for OS-level memory state
- Combined paste of two or more of the above; apply all applicable checks
- A natural language description of symptoms ("PLE is 200 and dropping, RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE is 15% of waits")

## Buffer Pool and PLE Checks (O1–O5)

Run these first to determine if SQL Server is under immediate memory pressure.

### O1 — Low Page Life Expectancy
- **Trigger:** `Page life expectancy` `cntr_value` in `sys.dm_os_performance_counters` (object `Buffer Manager`, or per-node `Buffer Node`) below a **buffer-pool-scaled** floor — roughly `(buffer pool GB / 4) × 300` seconds (so ~9,600 s on a 128 GB pool), **or** a sudden/sustained dip (see O2). Microsoft does **not** endorse a fixed value: per MS Learn, "a higher, growing value is best; a sudden dip indicates a significant churn." Use 300 s only as an absolute floor on small (≤4 GB) pools.
- **Severity:** Warning when below the scaled floor; Critical when PLE is below ~25% of the scaled floor (or < 60 s on a small server)
- **Fix:** Low PLE means pages cycle out of the buffer pool faster than the working set needs (scaling rule of thumb: 300 s per 4 GB of buffer pool, so a 128 GB server warrants PLE > ~9,600 s — a flat 300 s would hide pressure here). Investigate: (1) run O4 to check if one database dominates the pool; (2) check if a scan-heavy query is flooding the pool — run `/sqltrace-review` to identify full-scan workloads; (3) check if total committed memory is near Max Server Memory — run O20 to verify the setting.

### O2 — PLE Declining Trend
- **Trigger:** Multiple PLE snapshots show a monotonically decreasing pattern over ≥ 3 data points, with a rate of decline ≥ 10 s per minute
- **Severity:** Warning if 10–59 s/min decline; Critical if ≥ 60 s/min decline
- **Fix:** A sustained PLE drop means the buffer pool is being churned. Identify the source: correlate PLE drop timestamps with batch execution times in `/sqltrace-review` or Query Store. Common causes: a newly deployed query causing a large table scan, a growing database whose working set no longer fits in memory, or a maintenance job (REBUILD, DBCC CHECKDB) running without `WITH TABLOCK` / `WITH PHYSICAL_ONLY` limits.

### O3 — NUMA Node PLE Imbalance
- **Trigger:** When multiple `Buffer Node` PLE counters are present (multi-NUMA system), any node's PLE is < 50% of the maximum node PLE
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** One NUMA node is under higher memory pressure than others. This suggests either: uneven memory configuration across NUMA nodes (check BIOS / hardware), or queries are bound to specific schedulers/CPUs that concentrate working sets. Check `sys.dm_os_nodes` for memory allocation per node. Consider soft-NUMA if physical NUMA is unavailable.

### O4 — Buffer Pool Dominated by Single Database
- **Trigger:** A single database holds ≥ 60% of all pages in the buffer pool (use `sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors` grouped by `database_id`)
- **Severity:** Warning if ≥ 60%; Critical if ≥ 80%
- **Fix:** One database is evicting all others from the buffer pool. If this is the intended primary OLTP database, increase Max Server Memory (run O20). If it is unexpected (reporting DB, audit DB), consider: (1) partitioning workloads to separate SQL instances; (2) using Resource Governor with memory limits; (3) scheduling large scan queries during off-peak hours.

### O5 — Stolen Memory Excessive
- **Trigger:** Sum of all non-buffer-pool clerk `pages_kb` ≥ 15% of `committed_target_kb` from `sys.dm_os_sys_info`
- **Severity:** Warning if 15–29%; Critical if ≥ 30%
- **Fix:** Stolen (non-buffer) memory includes locks, SQL CLR, linked servers, plan cache, ColumnStore/XTP pools, and third-party extended procedures. Run O9 (locks clerk), O16 (ColumnStore), and O17 (XTP) checks. If CLR or linked servers are involved, review their configuration. Stolen memory leaves less room for the buffer pool, causing the PLE symptoms seen in O1.

---

## Plan Cache Checks (O6–O10)

### O6 — Single-Use Plan Cache Bloat
- **Trigger:** Single-use plans represent ≥ 30% of total plan cache size OR total single-use plan count > 10,000
- **Severity:** Warning if 30–59%; Critical if ≥ 60%
- **Fix:** Ad-hoc queries that run once generate plans that consume memory and are never reused. Enable `optimize for ad hoc workloads` (`sp_configure 'optimize for ad hoc workloads', 1`) to store only a stub on first execution, saving the full plan allocation until the query runs a second time. Longer term, parameterize application queries or use `sp_executesql` with parameters.

### O7 — High Plan Cache Compilation Rate
- **Trigger:** `SQL Compilations/sec` or `SQL Re-Compilations/sec` from `sys.dm_os_performance_counters` > 500/sec
- **Severity:** Warning if 500–999/sec; Critical if ≥ 1,000/sec
- **Fix:** Frequent compilations burn CPU and fragment the plan cache. Causes: unparameterized ad-hoc SQL (fix: O6), use of `WITH RECOMPILE` hints on hot paths, DDL/statistics changes triggering recompiles, or `SET` option changes per connection. Run `/tsql-review` on the top offending query text to check for recompile hints.

### O8 — Large Individual Plan in Cache
- **Trigger:** Any single plan in `sys.dm_exec_cached_plans` has `size_in_bytes` > 10 MB
- **Severity:** Warning if 10–49 MB; Critical if ≥ 50 MB
- **Fix:** Large plans typically come from queries with many joins, OR-heavy predicates, or dynamic SQL generating enormous statement trees. A 50 MB plan indicates a query that is too complex to compile efficiently. Review the query for: missing indexes that force large merge trees, OR predicates that could be rewritten as UNION, or dynamically constructed WHERE clauses that generate cartesian predicate combinations.

### O9 — Lock Memory Excessive
- **Trigger:** `OBJECTSTORE_LOCK_MANAGER` clerk in `sys.dm_os_memory_clerks` has `pages_kb` > 100,000 KB (100 MB)
- **Severity:** Warning if 100–499 MB; Critical if ≥ 500 MB
- **Fix:** SQL Server allocates a lock structure per row/page/object lock held. Excessive lock memory means: (1) row-level locking on very large result sets — review transactions holding locks and add appropriate WHERE clauses; (2) lock escalation is disabled or failing — check `sys.dm_tran_locks` for escalation events; (3) long-running transactions holding many locks — pair with `/sqlwait-review` for LCK_ wait analysis.

### O10 — Plan Cache Churn (Low Hit Rate)
- **Trigger:** Sustained plan-cache churn evidenced primarily by O6 (single-use plan bloat) and O7 (high compiles/sec). The `Plan Cache : Cache Hit Ratio` counter can corroborate, but treat a threshold on it as a **heuristic only** — MS Learn documents "90 or higher is desirable" for the **Buffer Cache Hit Ratio** (Buffer Manager object), *not* for Plan Cache Hit Ratio, which is just "the ratio between cache hits and lookups for plans" with no documented healthy floor and is often misleadingly near 100% even under ad-hoc bloat.
- **Severity:** Warning when O6/O7 show churn (low plan reuse, elevated compiles/sec); escalate with corroborating signals
- **Fix:** Diagnose with O6 (single-use bloat) and O7 (compile rate) — and `SQL Statistics : SQL Compilations/sec` vs `Re-Compilations/sec` — rather than the Plan Cache Hit Ratio counter alone. Enabling `optimize for ad hoc workloads` is the first mitigation; review parameterization next. (If you want a documented hit-ratio health check, use Buffer Cache Hit Ratio ≥ 90% from the Buffer Manager object.)

---

## Memory Grant Checks (O11–O15)

### O11 — Memory Grant Queue Depth
- **Trigger:** `sys.dm_exec_query_memory_grants` has any row where `grant_time IS NULL` (query waiting for a grant) — i.e., `wait_order > 0`
- **Severity:** Warning if 1–5 sessions waiting; Critical if > 5 sessions waiting
- **Fix:** Queries are queuing for memory grants, meaning the server has insufficient memory for parallel sort, hash join, and hash aggregate operations. Immediate: identify the queries holding large grants (column `granted_memory_kb`) and consider `OPTION (MAXDOP 1)` or `OPTION (MAX_GRANT_PERCENT = 10)` as emergency mitigations. Long-term: add indexes to eliminate hash operations; increase Max Server Memory if available physical memory allows (O20).

### O12 — Memory Grant Timeout
- **Trigger:** Error 8645 ("A timeout occurred while waiting for memory resources to execute the query in the resource pool") OR error 701 ("There is insufficient system memory in resource pool 'default' to run this query") in the error log. Note: `timeout_sec` in `sys.dm_exec_query_memory_grants` is the configured time-out before the query gives up its grant request, not an indicator that a timeout occurred
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Queries are failing due to memory exhaustion. Immediate actions: (1) kill the sessions holding the largest grants; (2) set Resource Governor minimum memory grant percent lower; (3) add `OPTION (MIN_GRANT_PERCENT = 1)` to the offending query. Root cause: the query's estimated row count is drastically wrong, causing an oversized grant estimate — run `/sqlplan-review` to check N21 (cardinality estimate accuracy) and `/sqlstats-review` for stale statistics.

### O13 — Oversized Memory Grant
- **Trigger:** Any single session has `granted_memory_kb` > 25% of `max_memory_grant` for the resource pool, OR `max_used_memory_kb / granted_memory_kb` < 0.25 (granted 4× more than actually used)
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** The query received a large grant but used a fraction of it, blocking other queries from getting grants (see O11). The grant overestimate almost always traces to stale or low-sample statistics on join input tables. Run `/sqlplan-review` on this query and look for N21 (row count estimate mismatch). Fix statistics with `UPDATE STATISTICS ... WITH FULLSCAN`.

### O14 — Resource Governor Memory Pool Imbalance
- **Trigger:** `sys.dm_resource_governor_resource_pools` shows a user pool with `max_memory_percent` = 100 or `min_memory_percent` = 0 when multiple pools are in use
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Resource Governor is configured but workload pools are not memory-bounded. Set `min_memory_percent` and `max_memory_percent` on high-priority pools (OLTP) to protect them from being crowded out by reporting workloads. Use `ALTER RESOURCE POOL` + `ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE`.

### O15 — Buffer Pool Extension (BPE) Active on SSDs
- **Trigger:** `sys.dm_os_buffer_pool_extension_configuration` shows `state = 5` (BUFFER POOL EXTENSION ENABLED)
- **Severity:** Info
- **Fix:** Buffer Pool Extension is enabled. Verify the BPE file is on a fast NVMe/SSD — placing it on a spinner negates any benefit and can worsen latency. Note: BPE is available in Enterprise and Standard editions only (introduced SQL Server 2014); if the workload outgrows it, additional physical RAM outperforms BPE.

---

## Memory Clerk, OS Pressure, and Configuration Checks (O16–O20)

### O16 — ColumnStore Buffer Pool Pressure
- **Trigger:** `CACHESTORE_COLUMNSTOREOBJECTPOOL` clerk in `sys.dm_os_memory_clerks` has `pages_kb` > 25% of `committed_target_kb`
- **Severity:** Warning if 25–49%; Critical if ≥ 50%
- **Fix:** Columnstore index structures (column segments and dictionaries cached for query execution) are consuming a large share of SQL Server memory. This is expected on a ColumnStore-heavy workload but reduces buffer pool space. Mitigations: increase total RAM; if the server runs both OLTP and ColumnStore workloads, separate them with Resource Governor; ensure ColumnStore indexes only exist on tables that benefit from them — run `/tsql-review` to check for unnecessary column store usage (T-series checks for ColumnStore on low-cardinality tables).

### O17 — In-Memory OLTP (XTP) Memory Pressure
- **Trigger:** The `MEMORYCLERK_XTP` clerk has `pages_kb` > 25% of `committed_target_kb`
- **Severity:** Warning if 25–49%; Critical if ≥ 50%
- **Fix:** In-Memory OLTP memory is unbounded by default — bind the database to a Resource Governor resource pool with `MIN_MEMORY_PERCENT`/`MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT` set, using `sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool` (database must go offline/online for the binding to take effect). If XTP memory is growing, check: `sys.dm_db_xtp_memory_consumers` for the largest consumers; whether durable in-memory tables have an appropriate checkpoint file footprint; whether non-durable (`SCHEMA_ONLY`) in-memory tables are accumulating rows that are never cleaned up.

### O18 — OS Memory Pressure Notifications
- **Trigger:** `sys.dm_os_ring_buffers WHERE ring_buffer_type = N'RING_BUFFER_RESOURCE_MONITOR'` contains records with `RESOURCE_MEMPHYSICAL_LOW` or `RESOURCE_MEMVIRTUAL_LOW` notifications in the last 24 hours
- **Severity:** Warning for RESOURCE_MEMPHYSICAL_LOW; Critical for RESOURCE_MEMVIRTUAL_LOW
- **Fix:** Windows is signaling SQL Server that physical or virtual memory is critically low. SQL Server will shrink its buffer pool in response, causing PLE drops (O1). Root causes: (1) Max Server Memory set too high — another process on the server needs memory; (2) physical RAM is genuinely insufficient for the workload; (3) memory leak in a third-party component. Review `sys.dm_os_memory_clerks` for unexpected non-buffer growth. Set Max Server Memory to leave at least 4–10% or 4 GB (whichever is larger) for the OS.

### O19 — Lock Pages in Memory (LPIM) Misconfiguration
- **Trigger:** Server RAM > 32 GB AND `sys.dm_os_sys_info.sql_memory_model_desc` = `'CONVENTIONAL'` (LPIM not enabled on a large-memory server)
- **Severity:** Warning
- **Fix:** Without Lock Pages in Memory, Windows can page out the SQL Server buffer pool to disk even when `sys.dm_os_sys_memory` shows available memory. On servers with > 32 GB RAM running under memory pressure, enable LPIM via Group Policy (`Lock Pages in Memory` user right for the SQL Server service account). LPIM prevents OS paging but does not protect against OOM — Max Server Memory must still be set correctly (O20).

### O20 — Max Server Memory Not Explicitly Set
- **Trigger:** `sys.configurations` WHERE `name = 'max server memory (MB)'` has `value_in_use = 2147483647` (the default unlimited value)
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Fix:** Without an explicit Max Server Memory limit, SQL Server can consume all RAM, starving the OS, other services, and connection overhead. Set Max Server Memory using the formula: `Total RAM − OS overhead (4–10%) − SSAS/SSRS/SSIS if co-located − 1 GB per 4 GB RAM for non-buffer memory`. Use `sp_configure 'max server memory (MB)', <calculated value>; RECONFIGURE`. Then verify LPIM is enabled (O19) on large-memory servers.

## Companion Skills

- `/sqlwait-review` — RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE (V11), CMEMTHREAD (V12), and PAGEIOLATCH (V1–V3) waits are the live signal of memory pressure that this skill explains at the configuration level
- `/sqltrace-review` — identify which workload queries are flooding the buffer pool or acquiring large memory grants
- `/sqlplan-review` — N21 (row count estimate mismatch) and N15/N16 (sort/hash spills) explain why grants are oversized
- `/sqlquerystore-review` — Q23 (memory grant regression) and Q24 (spill regression) link plan changes to memory pressure events
- `/sqldiskio-review` — if PLE is low and `sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats` shows high latency, the working set is spilling to disk; disk I/O is the symptom of memory pressure
